Have created a Test file and test repo for lab submission
Created a master branch
Created a test branch(new branch) and have merged that branch with master branch
Added python file in test branch and have merged the test branch with master branch

I have done all the above operation on git and then pushed the files into the Github host repository - AIDI-2004_Test, where i have created the repo manually on Github.
